City Pilots Late-Night Library Hours to Boost Access

The downtown public library will extend weekday hours to 9 p.m. for a six-month pilot starting October 1. City officials say the change targets working families, community college students, and adult-education learners who struggle to visit before 6 p.m. The library will add two part-time evening assistants and a contracted security guard during the pilot.

Demand indicators have been trending up: evening door counts rose 18% over the past year, and Wi-Fi sessions between 6–8 p.m. now average 240 per week. Librarians say the most requested services after 6 p.m. are quiet study space, computer access for job applications, and language-learning resources. A small business support desk is also testing “office hours” two nights a week with volunteer mentors.

Skeptics worry about costs and safety. The pilot’s budget is capped at $72,000, including overtime and security. Two nearby branches reported minor incidents after 7 p.m. last fall, mostly related to loitering and noise complaints. The city’s risk team says security will coordinate with a neighborhood ambassador program and add brighter exterior lighting on the south entrance.

If the pilot meets targets—5% circulation growth after 6 p.m., a 10-point rise in user satisfaction among evening patrons, and stable incident reports—the administration will propose making late hours permanent next spring. Supporters argue later hours could reduce pressure on crowded coffee shops and provide safer study alternatives for teens. Staff unions want clearer guidelines on overtime rotation and de-escalation training before any permanent expansion.
