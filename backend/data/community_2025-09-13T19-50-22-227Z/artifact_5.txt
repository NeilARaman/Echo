City Council Eyes 2027 Gas Leaf Blower Phase-Out Amid Noise and Emissions Concerns A proposed ordinance would phase out gas-powered leaf blowers by 2027, citing high-decibel noise and local air-quality impacts. Small landscaping firms warn that battery equipment is costly and may not last full shifts. The city says pilot programs in two districts cut complaints and reduced particulate spikes on high-use days. The plan includes rebates for low-income crews, quiet hours near clinics and schools, and a review of exemptions for wildfire clean-up. Opponents say city modeling underestimates replacement costs; supporters argue health gains and worker hearing protection justify the timeline.
