Health and Air Quality
- Two-stroke engines emit unburned hydrocarbons and fine particulates; exposure correlates with respiratory irritation.
- Hearing protection standards recommend limiting exposure above 85 dB for workers.
- Hospital outpatient visits for asthma flare-ups tend to cluster on high landscaping activity days in some datasets (observational).
