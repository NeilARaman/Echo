Small landscaping firms warn that battery equipment is costly and may not last full shifts. The city says pilot programs in two districts cut complaints and reduced particulate spikes on high-use days. The plan includes rebates for low-income crews, quiet hours near clinics and schools, and a review of exemptions for wildfire clean-up.
