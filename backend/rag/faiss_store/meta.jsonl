And we must ensure that Millennials have the resources and opportunities to express their identities with a loud and clear voice, and to turn that voice into effective action.\n\nTags\n\n[political ideology](https://circle.tufts.edu/tags/political-ideology)\n\n[political issues](https://circle.tufts.edu/tags/political-issues)\n\n[2016 poll](https://circle.tufts.edu/tags/2016-poll)"}

Millennials are also more racially and ethnically diverse than prior generations, with nearly 30 percent reporting Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial backgrounds, and more than 40 percent reporting nonwhite overall. In comparison, young adults in 1980 were only 22 percent nonwhite, with Black people representing more than half of this group. Millennials are also more likely to be single, college educated, and living in a city (Frey, [2018a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR24), [2018b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/article"}

Millennials are often portrayed in popular media as progressive and socially liberal (Milkman, [2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR59); Stoddard, [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR78)).

Given its combination of nontraditional perspectives and ethnoracial diversity, the Millennial generation has been described as a bridge that could “close the racial and cultural generation gap that, as recent politics have shown, is dividing the nation” (Frey, [2018a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR24), [2018b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR25):4).\n\nAn important component to closing this gap is reducing residential racial segregation.

The separation of where people live by race and ethnicity is an enduring feature of the American metropolitan landscape. Since peak segregation in the 1960s, Black-White segregation by some measures declined through 2010, albeit with levels remaining stubbornly high, while Hispanic-White and Asian-White segregation levels remained somewhat stable if not slightly increasing during this period (Logan & Stults, [2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR51)). However, at the same time improvements in metropolitan area segregation have stagnated, U.S. neighborhoods are becoming more racially and ethnically diverse (Ellen et al., [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR17)).

However, an empirical analysis of young adult residential settings might reveal diverging patterns from prior generations. A young adult cohort provides a market for radical changes because of its transitory and impressionable nature as its members are transitioning out of their parental homes, experiencing transformative life course events, and being exposed to new ideas while not being old enough to become committed to a career, residence, or family way of life ("}

A divergence in the residential patterns of young adults may signal a meaningful transformation, as well as provide insight on future trajectories. The current study contributes to the emerging literature examining the characteristics of the Millennial generation, focusing on the neighborhood racial diversity and segregation patterns among young adults from this generation, while also updating past work with recent data.

We examine both diversity and segregation because, as others have noted, ethnoracial diversity typically refers to the ethnoracial composition of neighborhoods, whereas segregation typically relates the ethnoracial composition of a larger unit of geography, such as a metropolitan area to its constituent geographies, typically census tracts (Iceland, [2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR30)).

[2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR19)). Moreover, the presence of diversity in an area can be a potentially fleeting step amid processes of racial turnover, with White households moving out as nonwhite populations progressively increase in representation (Kye & Halpern-Manners, [2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR40)).\n\nIn the following section, we summarize the demographic literature on generational change, paying particular attention to the characteristics distinguishing Millennials from previous generations.

According to the social identity perspective and generational identity theory, members of a generation have shared value systems that shape boundaries for social and self-categorization, whereby an individual identifies with their generation, potentially leading to the formation of a generational social identity (Mannheim, [1952](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR53); Tajfel, [1982](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR79); Tajfel & Turner, [2004](https://pmc.nc"}

The argument here is that even if generations may be difficult to empirically define, they exist as meaningful lived, social identities and are thus worthy of investigation (Milkman, [2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR59); Twenge, [2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR83)). A key argument justifying the empirical use of generations is that individuals within a generation tend to share similar characteristics, attitudes, and preferences, and these attributes typically differ across generations (Mannheim, [1952](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR53)).

In addition to its size, scholars have identified several important demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that distinguish Millennials from prior generations. In the most comprehensive demographic overview of Millennials, Frey ( [2018a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR24), [2018b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR25)) found that Millennials, in comparison to prior generations, are more likely to marry later, live in their parental home, and achieve a college degree. Further, Millennials are more likely to be foreign-born, be interracial, marry across race/ethnicity, and speak a language other than English at home (Frey, [2018a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR24), [201"}

As a consequence, Millennials are less well-off economically than members of previous generations in young adulthood, with lower earnings, fewer assets, and less wealth (Kurz et al., [2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12069491/#CR38)).

Urban cores typically house more ethnoracially diverse populations compared to suburban or rural areas.

We perform a decomposition that examines the extent to which the overall racial segregation within MSAs that occurs via age-sorting could be attributed to sorting between versus within neighborhoods. Here, we can think of the total amount of racial segregation in the MSA as being decomposable into two levels. On one level, total segregation can be explained by different racial/ethnic age groups concentrating into separate tracts.

To account for the possibility that changes in neighborhood diversity are primarily driven by a decline in young adult residents rather than shifts in racial/ethnic composition within young adult neighborhoods, we ran additional models controlling for the proportion of residents aged 35 and 64 years old. We are concerned that neighborhoods with fewer young people are becoming diverse over time, rather than due to neighborhoods with more young people failing to diversify.

In 2012, 47% of births to women in the Millennial generation were non-marital, compared with 21% among older women. Some of this gap reflects a lifecycle effect—older women have always been less likely to give birth outside of marriage. But the gap is also driven by a shift in behaviors in recent decades. In 1996, when Gen Xers were about the same age that Millennials were in 2012, just 35% of births to that generation’s mothers were outside of marriage (compared with 15% among older women in 1996).[12](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/#fn-4044"}

It is worth noting that when we refer to “all Americans” in this study, we are referring to adult Americans who are 18 and older.\n\nUnlike Gen Z teens, Gen Z adults are now eligible to vote — or have already voted — and largely face different life responsibilities. As they leave their adolescence behind, Gen Z adults are establishing their own paths, and cultivating their own identities and viewpoints as they gain independence and autonomy from their parents. Developmentally, Gen Z teens are distinct from Gen Z adults, as they are just beginning to learn how to better regulate their emotions, build relationships with their peers and adults, and grapple with larger questions about their role in their community and the larger world — including questions about politics.

Originally, I would’ve liked to survey people of all ages in order to get an accurate result to see where exactly those changes in social ideology took place. Because the survey was only sent out to college students, I decided to focus on the factors that play a role into the more common liberal views in the millennial generation. For this analysis, I will be focusing on LGBTQ rights as well as abortion rights.\n\nAccording to the Analysis of the General Social Survey Cumulative Data File, 1972- 2014, there is quite an increase in homosexual relations, but there is only a small increase in whether or not it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion (Clawson & Oxley, 2016: 63).

Both are controversial social issues, and I expect to come to realize why there are increases in each category. It will be important for me to take into consideration which specific theories and ideas have a part in the results. Generational and period effects, political socialization, mass media, and ideology, all play a great role in the evidence that shows why exactly the millennial generation is more liberal on social issues.\n\nA generational effect occurs when changes in the political context influence the political socialization of an entire age cohort (Clawson & Oxley, 2016: 60). A period effect occurs when salient features of the political period influence the political attitudes of many, regardless of age (Clawson & Oxley, 2016: 61).

It will be beneficial to understand how the generational and period effects play a role by studying previous generations and look at how exactly things have changed overtime.\n\nThe LGBT community is growing all over the world and it has become more of a “norm” in recent years. “One of the greatest contemporary challenges in human rights norm making is defining the protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression as an international standard” (Nogueira, 2017).

Protecting LGBTQ rights is taking place all over the world, and it is a growing platform (Nogueira, 2017).\n\nMass Media has changed dramatically in the past few years. The continuous innovative technologies have great effects on the political opinions of those who pay any attention to any type of media. Objectivity is something that is almost impossible to find in news sources today. For example, Fox News is known as a “republican” network and CNN is known as a “democratic” network. I believe that because mass media has such a large impact on our daily lives, that it must have something to do with the more “open-mindedness” when it comes to general human social rights.\n\n“Ideologically, they are more liberal.

Ideology and political parties definitely “shake up” the system. The problem is that there are people who are not necessarily interested in politics and they choose to vote just simply based on the party. Many people don’t even study the different policy issues and what each party stands for. This can cause great problems especially through research that is asking which party the subjects choose to identify with.\n\n# Methods:\n\nAnalyzing basic information as well as questions that are relating to social issues will be beneficial while conducting this survey analysis.

Nearly $32 %$ of the Millennial generation believe that allowing gay couples to raise children is a negative thing for society (Millennial’s: Confident. Connected. Open to Change, 2010). This is quite a decrease compared to the Gen X, Boomer, and Silent generations (Millennial’s: Confident. Connected. Open to Change, 2010).

For example, those who have grown up in a diverse metropolis area are much more likely to be openminded rather than those who have grown up in rural areas.\n\nTaking a look at specific party identifications within the millennial age range will be useful as well. Normally, society views liberalism to be open to social issues and conservatism to be more close-minded. Conservatism focuses more on tradition and value rather than diversity and civil rights. It is also possible that there could be a difference depending on how involved the parents are not only politically, but also with their children in general. “To be sure, Millennial’s remain the most likely of any generation to self-identify as liberals; they are less supportive than their elders of an assertive national security policy and more supportive of a progressive domestic social agenda” (Millennial’s: Confident.

The problem with this question, is there are always other scenarios that are brought up. It is such a grey question because people always tend to have certain “exceptions.” Looking at the questions relating to religion will also play a role in abortion. “Moreover, abortion is a most relevant topic for the analysis of the relationship between the national question and social policy because it brings the issue of religion to the forefront of that relationship, as religious factors and discourses are central to abortion debates around the world” (Kozloska, Beland, and Lecours, 2016).

The goal is to ultimately see on average what specific factors play into the liberal social opinions within the millennial generation. By studying these factors, I will actively work to achieve an accurate study.\n\n# Findings and Analysis:\n\n367 students answered a question about abortion based on which they most agree with.

Because of the demographics that the survey participants, there was not a great turn out concerning the metropolis area and the city. However, it is safe to say that within metropolis, suburban, city, large town, town, and rural area, the statement that said “Abortion should always be legal” took the lead.

The statements, “Abortion should always be legal” and “Abortion should be available in cases of rape, incest, or whenever the mother’s life is at risk” were tied. Only 15 people out of the 376 who answered this question were from the city, and that is the least amount of all other living categories.\n\n“While the pro-life movement tends to focus on fetus-centered narratives to bolster their arguments, the abortion rights movement chooses to focus on the narratives of women who have successfully defended their abortions to the public” (Settles & Furgerson, 2015).

The pro-choice advocates argue that it is the women’s right because it is her body. This idea is very complicated which is why it is considered a big issue today. After looking at the results from the survey, I was not surprised that more people from the millennial generation were pro-choice. I also think that religious preference plays a role in opinions on abortion.

This article examines whether these unique characteristics translate into greater neighborhood racial diversity and integration. Specifically, this study sets out to answer whether the neighborhoods where Millennial young adults live are more racially and ethnically diverse and situated in less segregated metropolitan areas than those where young adults from prior generations resided.

Consider that each tract within an MSA is comprised of several age groups (e.g., Late Millennials, GenXers, etc.). At this first level, we are observing, for example, White-Hispanic segregation between all \"tract-age groups\" within an MSA.

In contrast, we find either smaller or no reductions in segregation for older age groups. These patterns hold whether examining the segregation of White young adults from the total population or restricting the analysis to segregation solely among young adults. We further found the greater presence of White young adult Millennials is positively associated with neighborhood diversity. Collectively"}

Collectively, these results provide support for the characterization of Millennials as a bridge to diversity. However, our decomposition analysis disaggregating segregation to the age-group level suggests that the greater uneven sorting among Late Millennial young adults is also driving racial imbalances within neighborhoods among younger and older age groups.\nOur results further raise additional avenues for future research. Our findings are specific to the neighborhood level, and thus cannot be generalized to individual residential decisions.

However, IPUMS-NHGIS, in collaboration with census administrators, introduced and released an experimental data product (called “Differentially Private 2010 Data” or “Privacy-Protected 2010 Census Demonstration Data”) in 2023 that provided additional counts for the remaining race-by-Hispanic groups made possible by disclosure pr"}

The publicly available privacy-protected summary files produced via this demonstration product draw on underlying, untabulated microdata files (also privacy protected) for the entire nation. This privacy protection procedure in 2020 used a different disclosure avoidance system (DAS) compared to the initial procedures employed in 2010 and 2000 both in how noise is injected into the data, as well as in the minimum threshold applied to each racial/ethnic group’s tract population for disclosure eligibility (i.e., in 2020 there were no minimum population thresholds, but age-race counts were"}

To limit statistical bias, we restrict our analysis to the counts for Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic groups, which were included in the initial decennial census release.\nDisaggregated age by race by ethnicity counts are only available for a subset of the population in 1990, namely, the under-18 Hispanic, non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic nonwhite population. Race-by-age counts _are_ available in 1990 for other groups, but they did not disaggregate by Hispanicity (e.g., age-disaggregated counts for Black residents include those that are non-Hispanic and Hispanic, etc.).\nFor our decomposition, we aggregate population counts for only these age categor"}

We chose these categories to ensure that we measured a distinct category of young adults that mapped onto our generations while minimizing overlap between these cohorts in any year. Sensitivity analyses including population counts for all age categories generate the same substantive patterns.\nWe do experience some generational overlap, albeit minimal, for the 45- to 64-year-old age group in 2020. The earliest Gen Xers and late Baby Boomers fall within this age range in 2020, but the proportion of Boomers comprising this age group is much higher.\n**Publisher's Note**\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n## Reference"}

Looking at the location in which students grew up in could play a special role in social issues as well. For example, those who have grown up in a diverse metropolis area are much more likely to be openminded rather than those who have grown up in rural areas.\nTaking a look at specific party identifications within the millennial age range will be useful as well. Normally, society views liberalism to be open to social issues and conservatism to be more close-minded. Conservatism focuses more on tradition and value rather than diversity and civil rights.

Because of the demographics that the survey participants, there was not a great turn out concerning the metropolis area and the city. However, it is safe to say that within metropolis, suburban, city, large town, town, and rural area, the statement that said “Abortion should always be legal” took the lead.

After looking at the results from the survey, I was not surprised that more people from the millennial generation were pro-choice. I also think that religious preference plays a role in opinions on abortion.

For Turner, the unstable scenario created a generation that has difficulty dealing with problems and getting in touch with their own emotions, and that, while they are more open to new things, they are less attached to their own convictions, thus being less open to accepting dissenting points of view.\nAccording to the historian, this disorientation hits young men from Generation Z the hardest, as they end up seeking answers to some of their concerns in more conservative models from a past that the"}

We must implement multi-pronged, short- and long-term strategies for engagement that support all young people as they develop their civic and political identity. And we must ensure that Millennials have the resources and opportunities to express their identities with a loud and clear voice, and to turn that voice into effective action.\n\n- Add to Collections\n- Pe"}

These unique demographic characteristics, along with more progressive self-reported views on racial and ethnic issues, prompted some to label this generation as a demographic bridge to America’s diverse future. This article examines whether these unique characteristics translate into greater neighborhood racial diversity and integration. Specifically, this study sets out to answer whether the neighborhoods where Millennial young adults live are more racially and ethnically diverse and situated in less segregated metropolitan areas than those where young adults from prior generations resided. Using 1990–2020 Census data, we find that young adult Millennials are living in less segregated neighborhoods than their counterparts from previous generations. This pattern hol"}

However, our decomposition analysis, which disaggregates segregation to the agegroup level, suggests that increased uneven sorting among Late Millennial young adults is also driving racial imbalances within neighborhoods among younger and older age groups.\n**Keywords:** Segregation, Millennials, Diversity, Young adults, Generation, Neighborhood\n## Introduction\nIn the following section, we summarize the demographic literature on generational change, paying particular attenti"}

Consider that each tract within an MSA is comprised of several age groups (e.g., Late Millennials, GenXers, etc.). At this first level, we are observing, for example, White-Hispanic segregation between all \"tract-age groups\" within an MSA.

In contrast, we find either smaller or no reductions in segregation for older age groups. These patterns hold whether examining the segregation of White young adults from the total population or restricting the analysis to segregation solely among young adults. We further found the greater presence of White young adult Millennials is positively associated with neighborhood diversity. Collectively"}

Collectively, these results provide support for the characterization of Millennials as a bridge to diversity. However, our decomposition analysis disaggregating segregation to the age-group level suggests that the greater uneven sorting among Late Millennial young adults is also driving racial imbalances within neighborhoods among younger and older age groups.\nOur results further raise additional avenues for future research. Our findings are specific to the neighborhood level, and thus cannot be generalized to individual residential decisions.

However, IPUMS-NHGIS, in collaboration with census administrators, introduced and released an experimental data product (called “Differentially Private 2010 Data” or “Privacy-Protected 2010 Census Demonstration Data”) in 2023 that provided additional counts for the remaining race-by-Hispanic groups made possible by disclosure pr"}

The publicly available privacy-protected summary files produced via this demonstration product draw on underlying, untabulated microdata files (also privacy protected) for the entire nation. This privacy protection procedure in 2020 used a different disclosure avoidance system (DAS) compared to the initial procedures employed in 2010 and 2000 both in how noise is injected into the data, as well as in the minimum threshold applied to each racial/ethnic group’s tract population for disclosure eligibility (i.e., in 2020 there were no minimum population thresholds, but age-race counts were"}

To limit statistical bias, we restrict our analysis to the counts for Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic groups, which were included in the initial decennial census release.\nDisaggregated age by race by ethnicity counts are only available for a subset of the population in 1990, namely, the under-18 Hispanic, non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic nonwhite population. Race-by-age counts _are_ available in 1990 for other groups, but they did not disaggregate by Hispanicity (e.g., age-disaggregated counts for Black residents include those that are non-Hispanic and Hispanic, etc.).\nFor our decomposition, we aggregate population counts for only these age categor"}

We chose these categories to ensure that we measured a distinct category of young adults that mapped onto our generations while minimizing overlap between these cohorts in any year. Sensitivity analyses including population counts for all age categories generate the same substantive patterns.\nWe do experience some generational overlap, albeit minimal, for the 45- to 64-year-old age group in 2020. The earliest Gen Xers and late Baby Boomers fall within this age range in 2020, but the proportion of Boomers comprising this age group is much higher.\n**Publisher's Note**\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n## Reference"}

Compared to older cohorts, Millennial’s are more supportive of LGBT rights, racial and gender equality, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and government involvement to address societal ills” (Clawson & Oxley, 2016: 62).

Looking at the location in which students grew up in could play a special role in social issues as well. For example, those who have grown up in a diverse metropolis area are much more likely to be openminded rather than those who have grown up in rural areas.\nTaking a look at specific party identifications within the millennial age range will be useful as well.

As abortion continues to be an issue, it is still considered an “ethical challenge for Protestants and Catholics” (Stettner and Douville, 2016).\nOverall, all these different variables will play a role in my study.

Because of the demographics that the survey participants, there was not a great turn out concerning the metropolis area and the city. However, it is safe to say that within metropolis, suburban, city, large town, town, and rural area, the statement that said “Abortion should always be legal” took the lead.

After looking at the results from the survey, I was not surprised that more people from the millennial generation were pro-choice. I also think that religious preference plays a role in opinions on abortion.

Gay rights started to become more of a norm in the early 2000’s, but the transgender bathroom issue is a much more recent issue.

In his book ‘Generation Z: Technology and Social Interest’, American psychologist Antony Turner delves into the impacts on the psychosocial development of this generation due to the fact that they grew up in the midst of the great economic recession that began in 2008. For Turner, the unstable scenario created a generation that has difficulty dealing with problems and getting in touch with their own emotions, and that, while they are more open to new things, they are less attached to their own convictions, thus being less open to accepting dissenting points of view.\nAccording to the historian, this disorientation hits young men from Generation Z the hardest, as they end up seeking answers to some of their concerns in more conservative models from a past that the"}

With companies giving more visibility to the issue, and women increasingly gaining leadership positions in the job market, young men are faced with a scenario in which the male figure is losing its isolated protagonism – which can generate insecurities and fuel the idealisation that the situation was better ‘before’, because it was more favorable to them.\n## A discussion that g"}
